This is me refreshing my Infosec memory, sharpening my skills and widening my knowledge. The content of this blog will reflect my daily technical studies towards becoming a DFIR guru.

### More Information

You'll find here a compilation of my works and projects that pertain to information security in general, but seen through the eyes of a security analyst. Well, maybe I lied when I said *"my projects"* (I'll get there eventually), but more specifically various topics I read about either in my free time or at work.

### Current Reading

[Digital Forensics and Incident Response](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/digital-forensics-and-incident-response) by Gerard Johansen. This book is for total beginners, introductory to the field of digital forensics, less about incident response. It gives a nice explanation of the six-part SANS incident response process, also the babysteps into building an organization's IR capability. After you have finished reading, you will have a clear idea of what forensics topic you want to delve into later, i.e memory, network, or disk-based forensics. As for me, although I'm a networks guy (that's what my diploma says anyways), I choose to discover and exploit the realm of the memory world. Doing memory analysis is not easy (I believe it to be the hardest), but I came prepared with all the knowledge I acquired while I was writing windows drivers and rootkis, and malware analysis.
